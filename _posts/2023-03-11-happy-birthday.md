Hi mama, happy birthday. I wanted to write for you a short story, **Love Nathan**.

# Rubber rabbits, dogs, and ducks oh my!

We start our story at the house of a young little boy named Ethan. Ethan was a bit of a computer wiz kid, he loved to play games and watch videos on his computer. But he was lonely, no kids his age to play with. His mom was a fan of toys growing up so she always made sure on Ethan's birthday to get him a new toy. This year she got him a rubber duck. Ethan named the duck, "Ducky". Ducky sat atop Ethan's computer, watching him play games and watch videos. One day, Ethan had a tough day at school, he was being bullied by the other kids. He came home and went to his room, Ducky was there waiting for him. Without realizing he'd started doing it, Ethan started talking to Ducky. He told Ducky all about his day, how the kids were mean to him, and how he wished he had a friend. Ethan started to feel better and fell asleep with Ducky by his side.

Over the next few weeks, this became somewhat of a habit for Ethan. He'd come home, go to his room, and talk to Ducky. He'd tell Ducky about his day, his dreams, and his fears. Ducky would just sit there and listen, never judging, never interrupting. Lots of Ethan's problems seemed to melt away when he talked to Ducky. He would even talk to Ducky about his school work and miraculously afterward, he would find himself understanding the problem better and how to solve it. Ethan's mom noticed a change in Ethan, he was happier, more confident, and more outgoing. She asked Ethan what had changed and Ethan told her all about Ducky. Ethan's mom was so happy to hear that Ducky was helping. She even gave a name to Ethan's habit, she called it "The Rubber Ducky Method".

The next year, Ethan's mom decided to expand the family of rubber toys by getting Ethan a rubber rabbit and dog. Ethan, keeping with tradition, decided to name them "Bunny" and "Doggy". Ethan's mom told Ethan that he could talk to them just like he did with Ducky. Ethan was a bit skeptical at first, but he decided to give it a try. He found that talking to Bunny and Doggy was just as helpful as talking to Ducky. Ethan's mom was so happy to see Ethan's confidence grow and his grades improve. To this day, Ethan's mom swears she can sometimes hear the rubber toys speak back to Ethan.
